### Stack

**Old RBP**
+ If I can overwrite the _old RBP on stack..._
 - ... when _old RBP_ gets popped into the _actual RBP register..._
 - ... I may be able to control next functions reference to **local variables**
  * Since _local variables_ are referenced by `RBP - <some_value>`

+ I should make _old RBP_ point far back (depends on the next function)
 - Cause in next function get manipulated
 
 ^ ACTUALLY THIS MIGHT NOT WORK SINCE RBP BECOME ESP
